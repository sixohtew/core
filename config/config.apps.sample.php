 * YOUR INSTANCE. Instead, manually copy configuration switches that you
 * consider important for your instance to your working ``config.php``, and
 * apply configuration options that are pertinent for your instance.
 *
 * All keys are only valid if the corresponding app is installed and enabled.
 * You MUST copy the keys needed to the active config.php file.
 * 
 * This file is used to generate the configuration documentation.
 * Please consider following requirements of the current parser:
 *  * all comments need to start with `/**` and end with ` *\/` - each on their
 *    own line
 *  * add a `@see CONFIG_INDEX` to copy a previously described config option
 *    also to this line
 *  * everything between the ` *\/` and the next `/**` will be treated as the
 *    config option
 *  * use RST syntax
