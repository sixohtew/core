Feature: move files
As a user
I want to move files
So that I can organise my data structure

	Background:
		Given these users have been created:
			|username|password|displayname|email       |
			|user1   |1234    |User One   |u1@oc.com.np|
		And the user has browsed to the login page
		And the user has logged in with username "user1" and password "1234" using the webUI
		And the user has browsed to the files page

	Scenario: An attempt to move a file into a sub-folder using rename is not allowed
		When the user renames the file "data.zip" to "simple-folder/data.zip" using the webUI
		Then near the file "data.zip" a tooltip with the text 'File name cannot contain "/".' should be displayed on the webUI
