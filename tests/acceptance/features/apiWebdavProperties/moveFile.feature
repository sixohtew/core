  Scenario Outline: Moving a file
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "user0" moves file "/welcome.txt" to "/FOLDER/welcome.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the downloaded content when downloading file "/FOLDER/welcome.txt" for user "user0" with range "bytes=0-6" should be "Welcome"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |

  Scenario Outline: Moving and overwriting a file
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "user0" moves file "/welcome.txt" to "/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And the downloaded content when downloading file "/textfile0.txt" for user "user0" with range "bytes=0-6" should be "Welcome"

      | dav_version |

    When user "user0" moves file "/textfile0.txt" to "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then user "user0" file "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" should have the previously stored id
    And user "user0" should not see the following elements

		# yes, a weird bug used to make this one fail
    And as "user1" the folder "/folderA/ONE/TWO" should not exist
    And as "user1" the folder "/folderB/ONE" should exist
    And as "user1" the folder "/folderB/ONE/TWO" should exist
