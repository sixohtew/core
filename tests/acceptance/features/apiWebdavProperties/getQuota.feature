Feature: get quota
  As a user
  I want to be able to find out my available storage quota
  So that I can manage the use of my allocated storage

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "user0" has been created

  Scenario Outline: Retrieving folder quota when no quota is set
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When the administrator gives unlimited quota to user "user0" using the provisioning API
    And user "user0" gets the following properties of folder "/" using the WebDAV API
      | {DAV:}quota-available-bytes |
    Then the single response should contain a property "{DAV:}quota-available-bytes" with value "-3"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |

    When the administrator sets the quota of user "user0" to "10 MB" using the provisioning API
    And user "user0" gets the following properties of folder "/" using the WebDAV API
      | {DAV:}quota-available-bytes |
    Then the single response should contain a property "{DAV:}quota-available-bytes" with value "10485406"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |

  Scenario Outline: Retrieving folder quota of shared folder with quota when no quota is set for recipient
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "user1" has been created

    And the quota of user "user1" has been set to "10 MB"
    And user "user1" has created a folder "/testquota"
    And user "user1" has created a share with settings
      | path        | testquota |
      | shareType   | 0         |

    When user "user0" gets the following properties of folder "/testquota" using the WebDAV API
      | {DAV:}quota-available-bytes |
    Then the single response should contain a property "{DAV:}quota-available-bytes" with value "10485406"

      | dav_version |
      | old         |
