  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "2"
    And using new DAV path
    And user "user0" has been created
    And file "/davtest.txt" has been deleted for user "user0"

  Scenario: Upload file and no version is available
    When user "user0" uploads file "data/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "user0" should contain "0" elements

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: Upload a file twice and versions are available
    When user "user0" uploads file "data/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    And user "user0" uploads file "data/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "user0" should contain "1" element

  @smokeTest

      | shareType   | 0            |
      | shareWith   | user1        |
