	# Owner

	Scenario Outline: Uploading a file as owner having enough quota
		Given using <dav_version> DAV path
		And user "user0" has been created
		And the quota of user "user0" has been set to "10 MB"
		When user "user0" uploads file "data/textfile.txt" to "/testquota.txt" with all mechanisms using the WebDAV API
		Then the HTTP status code of all upload responses should be "201"
		Examples:
			| dav_version   |
			| old           |
			| new           |
