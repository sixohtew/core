Feature: sharing
	Background:
		Given using old DAV path
		And user "user0" has been created
		And user "user1" has been created

	@smokeTest
	Scenario Outline: Sharee can see the share
		Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
		And user "user0" has shared file "textfile0.txt" with user "user1"
		When user "user1" sends HTTP method "GET" to OCS API endpoint "/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares?shared_with_me=true"
		Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And the last share_id should be included in the response
		Examples:
		|ocs_api_version|ocs_status_code|
		|1              |100            |
		|2              |200            |

	Scenario Outline: Sharee can see the filtered share
		Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
		And user "user0" has shared file "textfile0.txt" with user "user1"
		And user "user0" has shared file "textfile1.txt" with user "user1"
		When user "user1" sends HTTP method "GET" to OCS API endpoint "/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares?shared_with_me=true&path=textfile1 (2).txt"
		Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And the last share_id should be included in the response
		Examples:
		|ocs_api_version|ocs_status_code|
		|1              |100            |
		|2              |200            |

	Scenario Outline: Sharee can't see the share that is filtered out
		Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
		And user "user0" has shared file "textfile0.txt" with user "user1"
		And user "user0" has shared file "textfile1.txt" with user "user1"
		When user "user1" sends HTTP method "GET" to OCS API endpoint "/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares?shared_with_me=true&path=textfile0 (2).txt"
		Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And the last share_id should not be included in the response
		Examples:
		|ocs_api_version|ocs_status_code|
		|1              |100            |
		|2              |200            |

	Scenario Outline: Sharee can see the group share
		Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
		And group "grp1" has been created
		And user "user1" has been added to group "grp1"
		And user "user0" has shared file "textfile0.txt" with group "grp1"
		When user "user1" sends HTTP method "GET" to OCS API endpoint "/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares?shared_with_me=true"
		Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And the last share_id should be included in the response
		Examples:
		|ocs_api_version|ocs_status_code|
		|1              |100            |
