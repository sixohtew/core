@api
Feature: add groups
As an admin
I want to be able to add groups
So that I can more easily manage access to resources by groups rather than individual users

	Background:
		Given using OCS API version "1"

	@smokeTest
	Scenario: admin creates a group
		When the administrator sends a group creation request for group "simplegroup" using the provisioning API
		Then the OCS status code should be "100"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And group "simplegroup" should exist

	Scenario Outline: admin creates a group
		When the administrator sends a group creation request for group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
		Then the OCS status code should be "100"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And group "<group_id>" should exist
		Examples:
			| group_id            | comment                                 |
			| new-group           | dash                                    |
			| the.group           | dot                                     |
			| left,right          | comma                                   |
			| España              | special European characters             |
			| नेपाली                                   | Unicode group name                       |
			| 0                   | The "false" group                       |
			| Finance (NP)        | Space and brackets                      |
			| Admin&Finance       | Ampersand                               |
			| admin:Pokhara@Nepal | Colon and @                             |
			| maintenance#123     | Hash sign                               |
			| maint+eng           | Plus sign                               |
			| $x<=>[y*z^2]!       | Maths symbols                           |
			| Mgmt\Middle         | Backslash                               |
			| 50%pass             | Percent sign (special escaping happens) |
			| 50%25=0             | %25 literal looks like an escaped "%"   |
			| 50%2Eagle           | %2E literal looks like an escaped "."   |
			| 50%2Fix             | %2F literal looks like an escaped slash |
			| staff?group         | Question mark                           |

	Scenario: admin tries to create a group that already exists
		Given group "new-group" has been created
		When the administrator sends a group creation request for group "new-group" using the provisioning API
		Then the OCS status code should be "102"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And group "new-group" should exist

	Scenario: normal user tries to create a group
		Given user "brand-new-user" has been created
		When user "brand-new-user" sends HTTP method "POST" to OCS API endpoint "/cloud/groups" with body
			| groupid   | new-group   |
		Then the OCS status code should be "997"
		And the HTTP status code should be "401"
		And group "new-group" should not exist

	Scenario: subadmin tries to create a group
		Given user "subadmin" has been created
		And group "new-group" has been created
		And user "subadmin" has been made a subadmin of group "new-group"
		When user "subadmin" sends HTTP method "POST" to OCS API endpoint "/cloud/groups" with body
			| groupid   | another-group   |
		Then the OCS status code should be "997"
		And the HTTP status code should be "401"
		And group "another-group" should not exist
