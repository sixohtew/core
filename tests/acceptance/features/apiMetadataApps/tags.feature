  Scenario: User cannot assign tags when not in the tag's groups
    Given user "user0" has been created
    When user "admin" creates a "not user-assignable" tag with name "TagWithGroups" and groups "group1|group2" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the user "user0" should not be able to assign the "not user-assignable" tag with name "TagWithGroups"
