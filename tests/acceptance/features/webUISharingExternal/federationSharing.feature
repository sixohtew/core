Feature: Federation Sharing - sharing with users on other cloud storages
As a user
I want to share files with any users on other cloud storages
So that other users have access to these files

	Background:
		Given using server "REMOTE"
		And these users have been created:
			|username|password|displayname|email       |
			|user1   |1234    |User One   |u1@oc.com.np|
		And using server "LOCAL"
		And these users have been created:
			|username|password|displayname|email       |
			|user1   |1234    |User One   |u1@oc.com.np|
		And the user has browsed to the login page
		And the user has logged in with username "user1" and password "1234" using the webUI

	Scenario: test the single steps of sharing a folder to a remote server
		When the user shares the folder "simple-folder" with the remote user "user1@%remote_server_without_scheme%" using the webUI
		And the user shares the folder "simple-empty-folder" with the remote user "user1@%remote_server_without_scheme%" using the webUI
		And the user re-logs in with username "user1" and password "1234" to "%remote_server%" using the webUI
		And the user accepts the offered remote shares using the webUI
		And using server "REMOTE"
		Then as "user1" the folder "/simple-folder (2)" should exist
		And as "user1" the file "/simple-folder (2)/lorem.txt" should exist
		And as "user1" the folder "/simple-empty-folder (2)" should exist

	Scenario: test the single steps of receiving a federation share
		Given using server "REMOTE"
		And these users have been created:
			|username|password|displayname|email       |
			|user2   |1234    |User Two   |u2@oc.com.np|
			|user3   |1234    |User Two   |u2@oc.com.np|
		And user "user1" from server "REMOTE" has shared "simple-folder" with user "user1" from server "LOCAL"
		And user "user2" from server "REMOTE" has shared "simple-empty-folder" with user "user1" from server "LOCAL"
		And user "user3" from server "REMOTE" has shared "lorem.txt" with user "user1" from server "LOCAL"
		And the user has reloaded the current page of the webUI
		Then dialogs should be displayed on the webUI
			| title        | content                                                                                              |
			| Remote share | Do you want to add the remote share /simple-folder from user1@%remote_server_without_scheme%/?       |
			| Remote share | Do you want to add the remote share /simple-empty-folder from user2@%remote_server_without_scheme%/? |
			| Remote share | Do you want to add the remote share /lorem.txt from user3@%remote_server_without_scheme%/?           |
		When the user accepts the offered remote shares using the webUI
		Then the file "lorem (2).txt" should be listed on the webUI
		And the content of "lorem (2).txt" on the local server should be the same as the original "lorem.txt"
		And the folder "simple-folder (2)" should be listed on the webUI
		And the file "lorem.txt" should be listed in the folder "simple-folder (2)" on the webUI
		And the content of "lorem.txt" on the local server should be the same as the original "simple-folder/lorem.txt"

		Then the file "lorem (2).txt" should not be listed on the webUI
		And the file "lorem (2).txt" should not be listed in the shared-with-you page on the webUI
