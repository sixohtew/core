Feature: get subadmin groups
As an admin
I want to be able to get the groups in which the user is subadmin
So that I can know in which groups the user has administrative rights

	Background:
		Given using OCS API version "2"

	@smokeTest
	Scenario: admin gets subadmin groups of a user
		Given user "brand-new-user" has been created
		And group "new-group" has been created
		And user "brand-new-user" has been made a subadmin of group "new-group"
		When user "admin" sends HTTP method "GET" to OCS API endpoint "/cloud/users/brand-new-user/subadmins"
		Then the subadmin groups returned by the API should be
			| new-group |
		And the OCS status code should be "200"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"

	Scenario: admin tries to get subadmin groups of a user which do not exist
		Given user "not-user" has been deleted
		And group "new-group" has been created
		When user "admin" sends HTTP method "GET" to OCS API endpoint "/cloud/users/not-user/subadmins"
		Then the OCS status code should be "400"
		And the HTTP status code should be "400"
		And the API should not return any data
