Feature: files and folders can be deleted from the trashbin
  As a user
  I want to delete files and folders from the trashbin
  So that I can control my trashbin space and which files are kept in that space

  Background:

      |username|password|displayname|email       |
      |user1   |1234    |User One   |u1@oc.com.np|
    And the user has browsed to the login page
    And the user has logged in with username "user1" and password "1234" using the webUI
    And the following files have been deleted
      | name          |
