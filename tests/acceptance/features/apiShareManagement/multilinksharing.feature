	Scenario Outline: Creating three public shares of a folder
		Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
		And the user has created a share with settings
			| path         | FOLDER      |
			| shareType    | 3           |
			| password     | publicpw    |
			| expireDate   | +3 days     |
			| publicUpload | true        |
			| permissions  | 15          |
			| name         | sharedlink1 |

			| shareType    | 3           |
			| password     | publicpw    |

			| permissions | 1 |
		Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
		And the HTTP status code should be "200"
		And as user "user0" the public shares of folder "/FOLDER" should be
			| /FOLDER | 15 | sharedlink2 |
